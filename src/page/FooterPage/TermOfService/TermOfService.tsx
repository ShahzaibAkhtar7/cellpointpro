            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed font-sans mb-4">
              We're proud to offer many powerful features for free, but some of our advanced tools and integrations are
              part of our Paid Services.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-[#264160] mb-3 font-sans">How We Charge</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed font-sans mb-4">
              Paid Services may include both Subscription Services (recurring monthly or annual fees) and Pay-As-You-Go
              Services (charged based on usage).
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed font-sans mb-4">
              By signing up for any Paid Service, you agree to pay the applicable fees and any required taxes. We'll
              collect payment using one of the following methods:
            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 font-sans mb-6 ml-4">
              <li>Your linked debit or credit card</li>
              <li>A deduction from your CellPointPro Wallet balance (if applicable)</li>
              <li>Your connected bank account</li>
              <li>Or from your payment processing proceeds (where supported)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-[#264160] mb-3 font-sans">Subscription Billing</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed font-sans mb-4">
              Subscription Services (like CellPointPro Pro as an example) are billed on a recurring basis—monthly or
              annually, depending on your selection—starting from your initial signup date. If you signed up with a free
              trial, you will be automatically billed once the trial ends unless you cancel beforehand.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed font-sans mb-4">
              You may cancel your subscription at any time by sending a cancellation request to Support by email or
              through the Support (?) button in CellPointPro. When you cancel:
            </p>

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 font-sans mb-6 ml-4">
              <li>You'll retain access to the service until the end of your current billing period.</li>
              <li>
                We do not offer partial refunds for unused time unless the cancellation is within 14 days of the
                original purchase or renewal date.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-[#264160] mb-3 font-sans">Fee Changes</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed font-sans">
              If we ever adjust our subscription pricing, we'll give you at least 30 days' advance notice. Continued use
              of the service after that notice means you accept the new rate.
